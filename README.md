## dotfiles
My dotfiles of XFCE desktop enviornment for Void Linux

## Usage
* Clone the repo, move there and run `chmod +x voidconf.sh zshconf.sh`
* Execute the script by `./voidconf.sh`

After completing first script, execute second one `./zshconf.sh`, if you want zsh shell and themes.

Extract `oh-my-zsh.tar.xz` by `tar xf oph-my-zsh.tar.xz` and rename the output directory with `.oh-my-zsh` (Note: By adding dot (`.`) before file name, will instantly hide the file, use CTRL+H or select "Show hidden files" from thunar to show all hidden files and folders)

Rename `config` with `.config`, now move both `.oh-my-zsh` and `.config` in your home directory, usually like `/home/username`

After these steps, change your theme with Fluent-round-dark and icon theme with Tela-ubuntu-dark.\
Remember, these steps can be done manually too! You may need to logout first to apply theme and icon changes, then login back.
